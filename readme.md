Objectives =
My objective was to produce a map which would go along with an NPR article I had read on rent and minimum wage. I wanted to show how many hours would have to be worked used the 30% rule to afford the rent of the average 1 bedroom apartment. I of course used data with respect to each state, so each state has a different number of hours worked.

Summary =
This map shows the link between Minimum Wage, and hours worked to afford the average 1BR apartment (using the 30 percent rule). I created it using leaflet and html for the main sections of my code. I got my US shapefile from the census and then converted it into a geoJson file in QGIS. I removed all of the layers which I would not need. Then I exported it and uploaded it to geojson.io, which then allowed me to modify the tables for the file more easily. I then manaully calculated the data for my map. I exported this file, and changed its file type into a javascript file. I then set it to a soure (Data) which allowed me to link it in my leaflet file. I customized the leaflet file to fit my needs.

Inspiration =
The inspiration for this came from a few articles I had seen like the NPR article below. Its an issue which has been around for a long time, but is finally becoming so glaringly obvious that it is showing up with major news outlets covering it. Clearly we have an issue in terms of our minimum wage if only 1 state can even get close to fitting the 30 percent rule at 40 hours per week.
